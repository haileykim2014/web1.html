One of the more famous quotes of Eleanor Roosevelt, this is definitely true and will help greatly in becoming the woman that you want to be. Instead of placing the blame on someone else for making you feel a certain way, take responsibility for letting them make you feel that way. This isn’t just true for feelings of inferiority, but for any negative feeling, sad, frustrated, disappointed, etc. You’re the one that is in control of how you feel, and others can’t bring you down unless you let them.
