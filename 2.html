  You’re almost there!
This is a great motivating phrase to help someone finish a task or goal. If someone is so close to finishing, why not just finish?

In this phrase, “there” usually does not mean an actual place (though it can). Instead, it often means the state of being finished or done.

A: I’ve been writing this paper for two months. All I have left is the conclusion, but I don’t want to work on it!

B: You’re almost there!
